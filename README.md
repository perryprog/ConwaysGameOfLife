:smile:

# Running

To run in a terminal do 
```Shell 
cd /Path/to/root/folder/of/program/out/production/ConwaysGameOfLife; java GameCreator;
```

**NEW** OS X only! (I don't do windows) run `./run.sh` and it will run. :smile:

# Using

When you first start it up it will give you a few prompts. The first three should be numbers. If you make a mistake it will crash. I was just to lazy to add a try catch. The forth prombt you must type in either true or false. That is all. :bowtie:

Now have some cake. :birthday: :birthday: :birthday: :birthday: :birthday:
